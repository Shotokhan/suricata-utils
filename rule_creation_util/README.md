# Snorpy
Snorpy is a python script the gives a interface to help those new to snort/suricata create rules and append them to their local ruleset. <br> <br>

I forked the original repository to add Suricata HTTP rules. <br>
Instead of refactoring the code, I decided to let the python script be self-contained. <br>
